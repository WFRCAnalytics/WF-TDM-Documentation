Documentation of the Wasatch Front Travel Demand Model (WF TDM) has been separated into three documents:

 - What's New Document – describes the changes made to the WF TDM since the last model release
 - Model Validation Report – provides the base year validation of the current version of the WF TDM, as well as a reasonableness check of the model as a forecasting tool
 - Model Process Report – provides an overview of the model, a summary of the model’s input data sets, and an outline of the model’s primary steps and logic

These reports will be available as PDF documents in the "_Notes" folder in the WF TDM’s root directory. However, it is expected that the primary means of accessing the model’s documentation will be online at the following links:

 - [What’s New Document](v9x/v910/whats-new/1-input-updates.qmd)
 - [Model Validation Report](v9x/v910/validation/1-distribute.qmd)
 - [Model Process Report](v9x/v901/model-process/emptylink) (in progress)
